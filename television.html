			<p>My favorite show of all time has to be Supernatural.</p>
			<p>The show is filled to the brim with suspense and great drama.</p>
			<p>I remember watching all 15 seasons of it during the COVID-19 lockdown, from start to finish.</p>
			<p>I can still remember some of the different intros the show used every season, each new intro being based around what the season will be focused on.</p>
			<p>On top of that, my favorite actor is one of the main ones, his name is Jensen Ackles and he is really good with his acting.</p>
